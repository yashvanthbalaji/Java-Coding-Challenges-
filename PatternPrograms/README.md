# 🎨 Pattern Programs in Java

This folder contains **Java programs** that generate different text-based patterns. These problems are great for practicing **loops, logic building, and nested iterations**.

---

## 📂 Programs

* **`TrianglePattern.java`** → Prints a simple triangle pattern with stars (`*`).

More pattern programs (e.g., pyramids, diamonds, number patterns) will be added soon!

## 🚦 How to Run

1. Open terminal and navigate into this folder:

   ```bash
   cd PatternPrograms
   ```
2. Compile the Java file:

## 🔎 Example Output

For `n = 5`:

```
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```

## ✨ Learning Focus

✔️ Nested loops (`for` inside `for`)
✔️ Handling input with `Scanner`
✔️ Printing structured text patterns

---

⭐ Keep practicing patterns — they sharpen your **logic** and **problem-solving skills**!
