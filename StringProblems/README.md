## 📂 Files Included

### 1️⃣ MinAndMax.java

🔹 **Description:** Finds the **minimum** and **maximum** numbers in a user-given array.
🔹 **Logic:**

* Input size and array elements.
* Initialize `min` and `max` with the first element.
* Traverse through the array, updating values as needed.

✅ **Example:**
Input: `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]`
Output: `Min = 1, Max = 9`

---

### 2️⃣ SecondMaxElement.java

🔹 **Description:** Finds the **second largest element** in an array.
🔹 **Logic:**

* Track both largest and second largest while traversing.
* Update properly when a new maximum is found.

✅ **Example:**
Input: `[12, 45, 1, 67, 34]`
Output: `Second Max = 45`

---

### 3️⃣ SumOfNum.java

🔹 **Description:** Calculates the **sum of all numbers** in an array.
🔹 **Logic:**

* Take input array.
* Use a loop to add all elements together.

✅ **Example:**
Input: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
Output: `Sum = 20`
